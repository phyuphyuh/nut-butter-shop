# Blue Jar Folks – *Modernized E-Commerce Site*

A modernized version of my final project from the *Introduction to JavaScript* course at **USC (2019)**. Originally built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS, this project has been fully rebuilt with modern web technologies: **React, Vite, TypeScript, Stripe, Auth0,** and deployed on **Netlify**.

## Overview

**Blue Jar Folks** is a ficticious small-batch nut and seed butter brand I made up. The site is essentially the brand's website and showcases products, provides detailed *“About”* sections, and allows users to add items to a cart and checkout securely via **Stripe**.

This project demonstrates how to take a classic JS project and modernize it for the current web ecosystem.

## Features

- **React + TypeScript**: Component-based architecture for scalability and maintainability.  
- **Vite**: Fast development build system.  
- **Shopping Cart**: Context API-based cart for adding/removing items.  
- **Stripe Checkout**: Secure payment processing with Stripe API.  
- **Auth0 Integration**: Optional authentication for future user accounts.  
- **Netlify Serverless Functions**: Handles server-side checkout logic and integrates with Stripe.  
- **Responsive Design**: Fully mobile-friendly layout with SCSS.  
- **Deployment**: Hosted on Netlify for continuous deployment.
